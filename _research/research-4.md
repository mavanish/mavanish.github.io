Quantum computing promises to transform the way we model correlated materials and chemical reactions.  We investigate hybrid quantum–classical strategies that deliver verifiable speedups over classical approaches while remaining compatible with near-term hardware constraints.

Research highlights include:

- **Algorithm development:** tailoring variational quantum algorithms for strongly correlated electrons, defect spectroscopy, and dynamical response calculations.
- **Error mitigation and benchmarking:** quantifying hardware noise, designing compact ansätze, and developing validation protocols that certify quantum advantage claims.
- **Domain-specific workflows:** integrating quantum solvers with classical simulations to tackle multiscale challenges in catalysis, energy storage, and quantum materials.

Through close collaboration with hardware providers and national laboratories, we test emerging technologies on real devices and map the practical pathways toward scalable quantum materials discovery.
